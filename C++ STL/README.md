## C++ STL (Standard Template Library) 
This folder contains all the STL features and inbuilt functions required to solve the problems in any competition in competitive programming.

The Standard Template Library (STL) is a set of C++ template classes to provide common programming data structures and functions such as lists, stacks, arrays, etc. It is a library of container classes, algorithms, and iterators. It is a generalized library and so, its components are parameterized. A working knowledge of template classes is a prerequisite for working with STL.
